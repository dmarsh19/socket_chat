## Socket Chat
#### A portable, lightweight LAN Messenger

A Python script that can be copied to as many machines as needed and allow basic chat functionality between machines.
Built using Python builtin modules only *(see Requirements section for tkinter issues on MacOS)*

**Compatible on:**
* Windows (7 Enterprise and 10 Home)
* MacOS (10.12 Sierra)
* Linux/GNU (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

**Requirements:**
* Python - Python3 Recommended. Python2 is supported *(see below for instructions for Unix/Linux)*
* tkinter - [IDLE and tkinter with Tcl/Tk on macOS](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/)

**In a Unix or Linux/GNU environment, the script tries to run with Python3**
If attempting to run using Python2, Linux/Uinx will require updating the first line from `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to `#!/usr/bin/env python`


#### Getting Started

Clone or download this repository. The entire application is the single file **chat.pyw**
If click to run is available (Windows), double-click the script to start.
Otherwise (Unix/Linux), **chat.pyw** can be initialized from a terminal:
`cd` to directory containing **chat.pyw**
`./chat.pyw`
